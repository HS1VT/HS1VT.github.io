        <h3>What Is Data Science and Aritifical intelligence?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Data Science brings together the best ideas from mathematics, statistics, computing, informatics and machine learning to design data driven solutions to problems spanning a wide range of application domains. 
            Artificial intelligence is study of "intelligent agents" that sense and interact with their environment to maximize the chance of achieving their "goal". 
            This is the technology behind search engines, recommendation engines, face recognition, speech recognition, self-driving cars, remote sensing,  etc. that are touching our lives in some way. 
            
        </p>
        <h3>Why Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI)?</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
           Together, these two fields have the potential to transform healthcare, businesses, industry, governance, education and society. 
           There is a growing need for skilled individuals who will serve as data scientists, machine learning engineers, big-data engineers, machine learning operations in various
            industries, not-for-profits, government agencies, and other organizations.
            There is also a great scope for entrepreneurship.
            
        <h3>Why B.Tech in DSAI?</h3>
        <hr>
           We  believe that the skills required for data science and artificial intelligence are fundamental and need to be given at an undergraduate level for greater skill creation.
        <p>
           The program offers strong preparation in computing, algorithms, statistical modeling, machine learning, optimization, artificial intelligence, management and analysis of massive data sets, data acquisition and data visualization.  
           The program focuses on topics such as reproducible data analysis, collaborative problem solving, visualization and communication, information security and ethical issues that arise in data science.
         
        <br> 
            The industry-relevant curriculum gives you the skills to extract valuable insights from big data.
            In this program, you will learn expertise in statistical modeling, data management, machine learning, data visualization, software engineering, research design, 
            data ethics, and user experience to meet the growing needs of industry, not-for-profits, government agencies, and other organizations.
